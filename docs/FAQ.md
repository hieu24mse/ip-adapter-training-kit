## Getting Started

### What is IP-Adapter?
**Q: What is IP-Adapter and how does it work?**

A: IP-Adapter (Image Prompt Adapter) is a lightweight adapter that enables image-guided text-to-image generation. It allows you to use reference images to control the style, composition, and features of generated content by injecting image features into the cross-attention layers of pre-trained diffusion models.

**Q: What's the difference between IP-Adapter and fine-tuning a diffusion model?**

A: IP-Adapter is much more efficient - it only trains ~22M parameters vs. freezing the entire diffusion model (~860M parameters). Training takes 5-15 minutes instead of weeks, requires only 5 images instead of millions, and uses 10x less computational resources.

**Q: Can I use IP-Adapter with different base models?**

A: Yes! Once trained, IP-Adapter can be used with any custom model fine-tuned from the same base model (like Stable Diffusion v1.5). It's also compatible with ControlNet and other controllable generation tools.

## Training Process

### Setup and Requirements

**Q: What are the minimum system requirements for training?**

A: Minimum: 8GB+ VRAM GPU, 16GB RAM, 20GB storage. Training takes 5-15 minutes on modern GPUs (RTX 3080+) or 20-30 minutes on Apple M2 Max. CPU-only training is possible but takes 2-3 hours.

**Q: How do I set up the training environment?**

A: Clone the IP-Adapter repository, install requirements (`pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt`), and run the training script (`python scripts/train_mini_dataset.py`). The setup script handles most dependencies automatically.

**Q: Can I train with my own dataset?**

A: Yes! Replace the images in `examples/mini_dataset/images/` with your images and update `data.json` with appropriate captions. For best results, use 5-20 high-quality images with detailed, consistent captions.

### Training Configuration

**Q: What training parameters should I use?**

A: Default settings work well: 10 epochs, batch size 1, learning rate 1e-4. For larger datasets, try 20 epochs with learning rate 5e-5. The training script auto-detects your hardware and optimizes settings accordingly.

**Q: How long does training take on different hardware?**

A: 
- RTX 4090: 3-5 minutes
- RTX 4080: 5-8 minutes  
- RTX 3080: 8-15 minutes
- Apple M2 Max: 20-30 minutes
- CPU only: 2-3 hours

**Q: How do I know if training is working correctly?**

A: Monitor the loss curve - it should decrease steadily. The training script saves checkpoints every 5 steps. You can also run evaluation tests during training to check progress.

## Technical Architecture

### Model Components

**Q: What does the UNet do in IP-Adapter training?**

A: UNet is the core generation engine that performs iterative denoising. In IP-Adapter, the UNet remains frozen (~860M parameters) while only the custom attention processors (~22M parameters) are trained to inject image features.

**Q: How does IP-Adapter modify the attention mechanism?**

A: IP-Adapter adds custom attention processors to cross-attention layers (attn2) that combine text features with image features. Self-attention layers (attn1) remain unchanged to preserve spatial relationships.

**Q: What's the role of CLIP in IP-Adapter?**

A: CLIP ViT-Large/14 (~1GB) extracts semantic features from reference images. These features are processed through a trainable MLP and injected into the diffusion model's cross-attention layers.

### System Architecture

**Q: What models are involved in the complete IP-Adapter system?**

A: The system uses Stable Diffusion v1.5 (~4GB), CLIP image encoder (~1GB), and trained IP-Adapter weights (~100MB), totaling ~5.1GB for the complete system.

**Q: How does IP-Adapter handle both text and image conditioning?**

A: The model concatenates text embeddings from CLIP text encoder with image embeddings from the IP-Adapter image projection model, allowing simultaneous text and image guidance.

## Evaluation and Performance

### Accuracy Metrics

**Q: How do I evaluate my trained model's performance?**

A: Use the provided evaluation scripts:
- `check_model_accuracy.py` for quick accuracy tests
- `evaluate_model.py` for comprehensive evaluation

Both measure reference preservation (70-85% target) and prompt following (70-80% target).

**Q: What accuracy should I expect with the mini dataset?**

A: Typical results: 75-85% reference preservation, 70-80% prompt following, overall grade B to A (Good to Very Good). Performance depends on dataset quality and training consistency.

**Q: How do I interpret the evaluation metrics?**

A: The system uses dual-objective accuracy:
- **Reference Preservation**: How well generated images maintain reference image features (CLIP image-to-image similarity)
- **Prompt Following**: How well images follow text prompts (CLIP image-to-text similarity)

### Performance Optimization

**Q: How can I improve my model's accuracy?**

A: 
1. Use more training images (20+ vs. 5)
2. Improve caption quality with detailed descriptions
3. Train for more epochs (20 vs. 10)
4. Use consistent, high-quality reference images
5. Experiment with different scale values during generation

**Q: My model works well overall but struggles with specific cases. What should I do?**

A: This is normal. The mini dataset provides narrow specialization. Consider:
- Adding more diverse training examples
- Using ensemble methods (multiple generations, select best)
- Fine-tuning generation parameters (scale, guidance, steps)

## Usage and Deployment

### Production Use

**Q: How do I use my trained model for generation?**

A: Run `python scripts/use_trained_model_proper.py --image your_reference.jpg --prompt "your prompt" --output result.jpg`. The script automatically loads the converted model weights and generates images.

**Q: What's the difference between the training checkpoint and production model?**

A: Training produces Accelerate format checkpoints. Run `convert_checkpoint.py` to create `trained_ip_adapter.safetensors` - the production-ready format for inference.

**Q: Can I integrate this into my own application?**

A: Yes! The production script shows how to load models and generate images. You can adapt this code for web apps, APIs, or other applications.

### Generation Parameters

**Q: How do I control the influence of the reference image vs. text prompt?**

A: Adjust the `scale` parameter:
- Higher scale (1.5+): Stronger reference image influence
- Lower scale (0.8): Stronger text prompt influence  
- Default scale (1.0): Balanced influence

**Q: What generation settings work best?**

A: Start with: 50 inference steps, guidance scale 7.5, scale 1.0. For higher quality, try 75 steps. For faster generation, use 30 steps. Experiment with scale 0.5-1.5 based on your needs.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Training fails with CUDA out of memory errors. What should I do?**

A: 
1. Reduce batch size to 1 (default)
2. Use mixed precision (fp16) 
3. Close other GPU applications
4. Try gradient checkpointing if available
5. Use CPU training as fallback

**Q: My generated images don't look like the reference. What's wrong?**

A: 
1. Check if model conversion completed successfully
2. Verify you're using the right scale parameter
3. Ensure reference image is high quality and clear
4. Try different random seeds
5. Check if prompt conflicts with reference image style

**Q: The training script can't find required files. How do I fix this?**

A: 
1. Ensure IP-Adapter repository is cloned: `git clone https://github.com/tencent-ailab/IP-Adapter.git IP-Adapter-main`
2. Check that `examples/mini_dataset/` contains images and `data.json`
3. Verify all requirements are installed: `pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt`

### Performance Issues

**Q: Training is very slow. How can I speed it up?**

A: 
1. Use GPU instead of CPU
2. Enable mixed precision (fp16/bf16)
3. Increase dataloader workers (if you have multiple CPU cores)
4. Use SSD storage instead of HDD
5. Close unnecessary applications

**Q: Evaluation takes too long. Can I speed it up?**

A: Yes! Use `--quick-eval` flag for basic accuracy check, or reduce the number of test images. Full evaluation is comprehensive but optional for quick testing.
